This repository contains the code developed for my thesis, which investigates the integration of resilience and privacy in multi-agent systems. It is organized into dedicated modules for resilience and privacy, along with a shared utility library. The project aims to provide a foundation for exploring advanced techniques and practical implementations in these areas.
